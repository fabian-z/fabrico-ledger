Fabrico Ledger is a project for prototyping a byzantine-fault tolerant distributed ledger system for secure and decentralized distribution of licenses and production data for computer-aided manufacturing systems, such as additive manufacturing / 3D printing and CNC machines.

An integrated digital twin simulating G-Code manufacturing provides the ability to control tolerances and provide quality assurance throughout the complete process.

Interfaces and functions will be developed for three parties, running a full node each:

- Original manufacturer (data provider)
- Data logistics (providing large file storage nodes)
- Contracted manufacturers

Project work for DHBW LÃ¶rrach.

## Used key technologies

- SmartBFT Consensus Algorithm / Library
- gRPC (with TLS) & Protobuf
- State of the art encryption / signatures
  - EdDSA with Ed25519
  - X25519
  - ECIES with ChaCha20-Poly1305
- mDNS & DNS-SD for automatic Node Discovery

## User Interface

The user interface for interacting with the distributed ledger is written in HTML5 / JavaScript using the Bootstrap Framework with Chart.js for future visualization of system status.
